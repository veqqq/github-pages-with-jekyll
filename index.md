# Hi Bahar

I'm glad you are here. I am procrastinating by learning how to use github. This is good, but it is also bad because:
- I should have known how to use this years ago
- I should be writing that thing
- actually, that's all my reasons.

# But also...

I am learning the markdown language which is a way of simply formatting text.
